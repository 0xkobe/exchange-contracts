# Pangolin Smart Contracts
This repo contains all of the smart contracts used to run [Pangolin](pangolin.exchange).

## Running
These contracts are compiled and deployed using the Remix IDE. A tutorial for using Remix is located [here](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask).
